## elm-upgrade [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/elm-upgrade.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-upgrade) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/avh4/elm-upgrade.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/avh4/elm-upgrade)

`elm-upgrade` can help you **upgrade your Elm 0.18 projects to Elm 0.19**.  It attempts to automate many of the steps in the [Elm 0.19 upgrade guide][upgrade].  `elm-upgrade` will do the following:
  - Convert your `elm-package.json` file to ...
    - ... an application `elm.json` if your project has no exposed modules
    - ... a package `elm.json` if your project has at least one exposed module
  - Try to upgrade all of your project dependencies
  - Warn you if some of your project dependencies don't support Elm 0.19 yet
  - Use [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) `--upgrade` to upgrade your code, which includes the following:
    - Convert escaped characters in strings to the new syntax (`\u{xxxx}`)
    - Inline uses of functions which were removed in Elm 0.19:
      - `(,,)`, `(,,,)`, etc tuple constructor functions
      - `Platform.Cmd.(!)`
      - `flip`, `curry`, `uncurry`, and `rem` from the `Basics` module
    - Upgrade code that uses `Html.Attributes.style`

`elm-upgrade` can also **upgrade dependencies of your Elm 0.19 applications**.
If you are already using Elm 0.19, `elm-upgrade` will to the following:
  - check for newer versions of all your direct dependencies and try to install them


## How to use **elm-upgrade**

First install Elm 0.19.1 and the latest version of [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#installation-).  (If you want to install them locally for your project, you can do so with the following: )

```sh
cd path/to/my/elm/project
npm install elm@latest-0.19.1
npm install elm-format@latest-0.19.1
```

Then run the following in your terminal:

```sh
cd path/to/my/elm/project
npx elm-upgrade@latest
```

NOTE:  `npx` ships with node 8.2 and later.  If you need to use an older version of node, you can still use elm-upgrade with `npm install -g elm-upgrade; elm-upgrade`.

After the automated upgrade, you will probably still have to fix a few things.  See the [Elm 0.19 upgrade guide][upgrade] for more details.

INFO: Upgrading *.elm files in ./


SUCCESS! Your project's dependencies and code have been upgraded.
However, your project may not yet compile due to API changes in your
dependencies.

See <https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.19.md>
and the documentation for your dependencies for more information.

Here are some common upgrade steps that you will need to do manually:

- elm/core
  - [ ] Replace uses of toString with String.fromInt, String.fromFloat, or Debug.toString as appropriate
- elm/html
  - [ ] If you used Html.program*, install elm/browser and switch to Browser.element or Browser.document
  - [ ] If you used Html.beginnerProgram, install elm/browser and switch Browser.sandbox

$ git add -N elm.json
