## elm-upgrade ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/elm-upgrade.svg)

**elm-upgrade** helps you upgrade your Elm 0.17 projects to Elm 0.18.  It attemps to automate many of the steps in the [Elm 0.18 upgrade guide](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.18.md).  **elm-upgrade** will do the following:
  - Update the `elm-version` in your project's `elm-package.json` file
  - Try to upgrade all of your project dependencies in `elm-package.json`
  - Warn you if some of your project dependencies don't support Elm 0.18 yet
  - Use [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) to upgrade your code, which includes the following:
    - Infix function calls using backticks become normal functions calls
    - Infix function calls using backticks with `andThen` and `onError` become pipelines
    - Ranges become calls to `List.range`
    - Primes in variable names become underscores
    - References to `fst` and `snd` become `Tuple.first` and `Tuple.second`

## How to use it

To use **elm-upgrade**, first [install elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#installation-) and then run the following in your terminal:

```sh
npm install -g elm-upgrade
cd path/to/my/elm/project
elm-upgrade
```

After the automated upgrade, you will probably still have to fix a few things.  See the [Elm 0.18 upgrade guide](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.18.md) for more details.
